"Stay or Stray: Predicting Online Course Dropout" - where data meets education in a battle of predictive prowess! In this Kaggle competition, participants were tasked with harnessing the power of early interactions and activity patterns within online course platforms to develop a cutting-edge predictive model.

As the demand for online education skyrockets, understanding student behavior becomes paramount. With dropout rates posing a significant challenge, the need for accurate predictions is more pressing than ever. Imagine being able to identify at-risk students before they disengage, providing timely interventions and support to keep them on track. From login frequency to assignment completion rates, every click and keystroke holds valuable information waiting to be deciphered.

#### Overview

Despite the growing popularity of online learning platforms, high dropout rates remain a significant issue, hindering the effectiveness of these educational resources. By accurately predicting the likelihood of a student dropping out from a course, the providers and instructors can implement targeted interventions and strategies to improve student engagement and retention.

Provided with a rich dataset containing student enrollment information, activity logs, and derived features capturing various aspects of student behavior and engagement within the Online courses platform. These features include average delays in accessing course materials, content type preferences, activity counts across different days and hours, and indicators of parallel course enrollments.

#### Objective
To develop a robust machine learning model that can effectively predict whether a student will drop out or continue in a course, based on their early interactions and engagement patterns.
